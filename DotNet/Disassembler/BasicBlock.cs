    /// A basic block is a contiguous sequence of instructions such that in a
    /// well-behaved program, if any of these instructions is executed, then
    /// all the rest instructions must be executed.
    /// 
    /// For example, a basic block may begin with an instruction that is the
    /// target of a JMP instruction, continue execution for a few 
    /// instructions, and end with another JMP instruction.
    /// 
    /// In a control flow graph, each basic block can be represented by a
    /// node, and the control flow can be expressed as directed edges linking
    /// these nodes.
    /// 
    /// For the purpose in our application, we do NOT terminate a basic block
    /// when we encounter a CALL instruction. This has the benefit that the
    /// resulting control flow graph won't have too many nodes that merely
    /// call another function.
